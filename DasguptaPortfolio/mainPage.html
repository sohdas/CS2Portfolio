            <h3>YEARBOOK</h3>
            <p>
                This time was mainly comprised of me educating myself with CSS principles and how to organize a web-page.
                Through the mistakes I made in this, I quickly learned the importance of dividing web pages into manageable sections and
                understanding the unintended consequences of CSS styling decisions. However, since this webpage was to have no functionality
                other than displaying text and images, I didn’t have to take any potential future functions into account.

            <p>
                As this final, most significant project started, I was more familiar with CSS styling due to the learning I did during the Yearbook Page.
                I used my knowledge to create a more aesthetically pleasing website. This experience taught me the importance of creating
                a mockup before starting the webpage, because it set clearly defined goals and objectives. I also learned the value of
                teamwork and open communication; we needed to have a consistent design aesthetic across all of our individual pages that
                were linked to the home screen. Finally, I had to take function and effectiveness into consideration. Unlike the Yearbook Page,
                this project needed to emulate an actual web page which is navigated and contains buttons. Because of this, I learned to
                consider utility as well as content in my design choices. I gained more than just design experience from this endeavor, however. Having to devise a
                file-uploading and downloading system from scratch was at first a daunting task, delegated only to myself and one other person. In doing so, we 
                had to explore multiple different solutions. At one point, we even had a working solution, but it had to be abandoned due to a security issue. 
                Eventually, we settled on a secure, functional, convenient solution that worked on both mobile and desktop. Through that process, I learned valuable 
                lessons -- not only in file manipulation and security, but also in the nature of effectively approaching a large and complex issue of which you have little 
                background knowledge.

                Prior to this, my experience was only with strongly-typed languages such as Java. Having to use a weakly-typed language
                like Javascript forced me to reconsider my perspective. By this time, we also had developed strong communication as a team.
                For instance, we developed a loose protocol for when to branch and how to divide the labor. This led to us completing our
                objectives quickly and efficiently.

                One of the most significant challenges throughout this entire experience was familiarizing myself with the MVC model's concepts
                and implementation. The main obstacle here was trying to find a way to visualize the different layers of a database and how they interact.
                However, as I moved from the realm of learning to hands-on-practice, I established a more essential
                familiarity with the MVC model.
